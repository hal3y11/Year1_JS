    <p id="para1">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
    <p id="para2">'Curiouser and curiouser!'' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English);now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! </p>

    <div id="block1">
        <p>'Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). </p>
        <p> 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? <span>I'm sure I shan't be able!</span> </p>
